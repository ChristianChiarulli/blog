## What is a contract?

A contract is just an agreement between two parties.

A smart contract is an agreement between two parties on the blockchain.

## What makes it smart?

Typically, a smart contract is enforced by a third party. 

A "smart" contract is enforced by code living on the blockchain.

## Why are smart contracts so useful?

Needing a third party in an agreement is often necessary. But third parties will need to be trusted and can often be expensive.

Using a smart contract as our third party will remove the need for trust and will also cut out the middleman so to speak.
